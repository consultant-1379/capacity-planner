          The Capacity Planner is a tool that can be used to plan the design and layout of a cloud environment.
          It works in conjunction with an importer that can be used to read the actual data from the cloud and populate the Capacity Planner with this data in near real-time.

          The goal of the tool is to allow the administrators to plan out how the cloud resources should be allocated,
          taking into account variables such as iops, memory, cpus, cpu contention ratio etc, in the most efficient way possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result should be more efficient and effective use of the cloud infrastructure.
